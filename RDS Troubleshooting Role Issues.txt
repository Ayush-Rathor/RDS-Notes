Troubleshooting Role Issues

Understanding IAM and IAM role issues is crucial for managing access and permissions within AWS. IAM database authentication allows users to authenticate a DB instance without a password, using an authentication token instead. Below are detailed steps to identify, analyze, and resolve IAM-related issues.

1. Identify the Exact IAM Error
   - Common examples of IAM errors:
     1. `User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: rds:GetWidget on resource: my-example-widget`
     2. `User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/marymajor is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole`

2. Collect Data
   - Gather the following information:
     1. IAM policies associated with the IAM user facing the issue.
     2. The exact connect command used for IAM authentication.
     3. The AWS Account ID of the IAM user and the resource being accessed.
     4. Confirm whether the user is attempting to log in using a password instead of an authentication token.

3. Analyze Data
   - Validate and analyze the collected data:
     1. Ensure the generated authentication token is valid. Note: Tokens expire after 15 minutes and cannot be refreshed; they must be regenerated.
     2. Verify the exact action and resource associated with the error.
     3. Check IAM user permissions using the attached IAM policies.
     4. Confirm whether the AWS account is part of AWS Organizations. If so:
        - Add `rds-db:*` to the Service Control Policy (SCP) of the organizational unit to which the account belongs.

4. Apply Possible Solutions
   - Resolve the issue based on the analysis:
     1. If the IAM user lacks permissions:
        - Contact the administrator to update policies, granting the user access to the required resource by allowing the specific action.
        - The administrator can be identified as the person who provided the IAM user credentials.
     2. For `iam:PassRole` errors:
        - Ensure the IAM user has permissions to pass the role to the service.
        - Update policies to allow the `iam:PassRole` action if necessary.
     3. Check and correct the connect command:
        - Ensure all required options, including SSL details, are provided.
        - Note: SSL connections are mandatory for IAM authentication.
