Monitoring Amazon RDS  

AWS provides various monitoring tools to watch Amazon RDS, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when appropriate.

Automated Monitoring Tools:  

1. Amazon RDS Instance Status:  
   - Provides details about the current status of your instance.  
   - Example: Database-1 has a status of "available."  

2. Recommendations Tab:  
   - Offers actionable advice to improve performance and monitoring capabilities.  
   - Example: Enhanced monitoring is not enabled on two DB instances. One is running on a classic EC2 instance, and one is running on magnet storage.  

3. Amazon CloudWatch Integration:  
   - Provides additional monitoring capabilities.  
   - Includes CloudWatch metrics and CloudWatch alarms.  
   - Example: Database-1 is idle with minimal activity.  

4. CloudWatch Metrics:  
   - Includes CPU utilization, DB connections, free storage space, freeable memory, and read/write IOPS.

Amazon RDS Performance Insights and Operating-System Monitoring:  

1. Amazon RDS Performance Insights:  
   - Helps assess the load on your database.  

2. Enhanced Monitoring:  
   - Allows you to view metrics in real-time for the operating system.  
   - Example: No SQL statements are running against the DB instance "database-1."  

3. Database Load Metrics:  
   - Metrics include total memory, active memory, and free memory.  

4. Enhanced Monitoring View:  
   - Shows the resources used by the DB instance, such as free memory, active memory, page tables, CPU usage, and used filesystem.  

5. Operating System Processes:  
   - Displays system processes and the resources they are consuming. It is similar to the "top" command in Linux.
