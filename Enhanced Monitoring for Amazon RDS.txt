Enhanced Monitoring for Amazon RDS

Enhanced monitoring provides deeper visibility into the health of your DB instances by collecting operating system (OS) metrics and process information at a defined granularity.

How to Enable Enhanced Monitoring

1. Grant Permissions  
   - Enhanced monitoring requires an IAM role to send OS metric information to CloudWatch Logs.  
   - You can create this IAM role when enabling enhanced monitoring or beforehand.

2. Steps to Enable or Disable Enhanced Monitoring via Console  
   1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds.  
   2. Choose "Databases" and select a DB instance.  
   3. Click "Modify" and go to the "Additional configuration" section.  
   4. Under "Monitoring," enable "Enhanced monitoring" and specify:  
      - Granularity value.  
      - Monitoring Role.  
   5. Choose "Continue."  
   6. Verify the "Summary of modifications."  
      - For "Scheduling of modifications," select "Apply immediately."  
   7. Click "Modify DB instance" and wait for the changes to be applied.

Viewing OS Metrics in the Amazon RDS Console

1. Access Enhanced Monitoring  
   - Navigate to the Enhanced Monitoring page to view OS metrics.

2. Key Graphs and Metrics  
   - Physical Device Write IOPS:  
     - Displays metrics for each disk used by the DB instance.  
     - On instances with multiple disks, metrics for all disks are shown.  

   - Write KB per Second:  
     - Aggregated disk I/O and file system metrics.  
     - rdsdev device relates to /rdsdbdata (database files and logs).  
     - Filesystem device relates to / (root file system for OS files).  

3. Multi-AZ Instances  
   - For Multi-AZ deployments, you can view OS metrics for both:  
     - Primary instance.  
     - Standby replica.  
   - Use the Enhanced Monitoring view to toggle between "Primary" and "Secondary."

4. OS Processes  
   - View the list of processes running on the DB instance using the OS process list.

Enhanced Monitoring Metrics in the Process List

1. Amazon RDS Child Processes  
   - Displays metrics for processes that support the DB instance (e.g., mysqld for MySQL).  
   - Process threads appear nested beneath the parent process.  
   - CPU utilization is shown for threads, while other metrics are shared across threads.  
   - The console shows up to 100 processes and threads, prioritizing the top 50 consumers of CPU and memory.

2. Amazon RDS Processes  
   - Summarizes resources used by the RDS management agent, diagnostics processes, and other AWS services.

3. OS Processes  
   - Displays metrics for kernel and system processes, which usually have minimal performance impact.

Items Listed for Each Process

1. VIRT  
   - Virtual size of the process.

2. RES  
   - Actual physical memory being used by the process.

3. CPU%  
   - Percentage of total CPU bandwidth used by the process.

4. MEM%  
   - Percentage of total memory used by the process.
